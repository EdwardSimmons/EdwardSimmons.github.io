          <p>This page is intended to act as an introductory guide to the world
            of the Python programming language. Python was developed in the late
            1980s/ early 1990s by a Dutch programmer called Guido Van Rossum,
            who has since maintained the title "Benevolent Dictator for Life"
            thanks to his continued involvement in its development.
          </p>
          <p>Python is an object-oriented, interpreted language. Fear not, dear
            reader, if those terms are alien to you - both will be covered by
            this page (and you can navigate to either of those sections by
            using the sidebar).

          <p>It's tradition in computer programming that the first piece of code
            that you write in any given language is a "Hello World!" program - a
            simple program that prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the
            terminal window. This tradition is nearly as old as programming
            itself! Using "Hello World!" as a test message was influenced by an
            example program in the seminal 1978 book <em>'The C Programming
            Language'</em>.
          </p>
          <p>In Python, this task is incredibly simple (provided you have
            installed Python on your computer and have access to a text editor
            and a Python interpreter) as, in Python, it can be written in one
            line:
            <code> print("Hello, World!") </code>
            It doesn't get much simpler than that! Simplicity is one of the
            fundamental characteristics of Python as well as being one of the
            foundations upon which it was written, and is a large factor in
            its global popularity.

        <header>Data Types in Python</header>
        <article>
          <p>There are 4 fundamental data types in Python:
            <ul>
              <li>Numbers</li>
              <li>Sequences</li>
              <li>Booleans</li>
              <li>Dictionaries</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these data types contain subsets that are very distinct, and
            that are fundamental to the basic funtional workings of Python.
          </p>
          <h3>Numbers</h3>
          <P>There are three types of numbers in Python:
            <ul>
              <li>Intergers:
                <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5...</code></li>
              <li>Floating Point Numbers (a.k.a. "Floats"):
                <code>1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0...</code></li>
              <li>Complex Numbers:
                <code>x + yj</code> where <code style="display: inline">j</code>
                is the square root of -1, eg:
                <code>1 + 2j</code></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Sequences</h3>
          <p>There are also three types of sequence in Python. They're called
            "sequences" because Python can use each of these data types as
            iterables in loops, i.e. Python will accept these data types as
            instructions when executing code that loops around, such as an
            algorhithm. They are:
            <ul>
              <li>Strings:
                <code>"Hello World!"</code></li>
              <li>Lists:
                <code>[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]</code></li>
              <li>Tuples:
                <code>(1,2,3)</code></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>They can be of any length, or even be empty. Strings and Lists are
            mutable, whereas Tuples are immutable, i.e. Tuples cannot be changed
            or amended.<p>
          <h3>Booleans</h3>
          <p>A Boolean value is one of the fundamental aspects of computer
            programming. They can only take one of two values:
            <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>
            Python can also treat booleans numerically, in which case:
            <code>True == 1</code> and <code>False == 0</code>
          </p>
          <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
          <p>A Dictionary is a unique data type that acts as, you gussed it, a
            dictionary which contains any number of key:value pairs that the
            user can utilise in order to translate any of their variables.</p>
          <p>Dictionaries are declared in the following way:
            <code> dict = {cat: kot, dog: pies, lion: lew}</code>
            This dictionary effectively acts as an English-to-Polish translator.
            Sending the word "dog" to the dictionary results in the word "lew"
            being returned.

          <p>So, now that you know what the 4 main data types are, you may be
            wondering "how do I store any of these data types?". How astute! The
            answer, reader dear, is variables.</p>
          <p>We have in fact already discussed a variable. In my definition of
            the Dictionary data type, you may have noticed that I used the word
            "declared" when I gave an example of a Dictionary. Declaration is
            the process by which we create variables in Python. Variables are
            declared by using the <code style="display: inline">=</code>
            operator. For example, if I wanted to store a pythagorean triple
            called <code style="display: inline">py_tup</code> as a Tuple, I
            would type:
            <code>py_tup = (3.0, 4.0, 5.0)</code></p>
          <p>Variables are the bread and butter of modern computing.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Again, I've sneakily already inroduced you to an arithmetic
            operator, so they can't be too difficult to understand right? These
            handy symbols are how you as the user explain to Python what you
            want to happen in any given operation. They can also be used in
            logical tests (which is the example you've seen), as well as some
            string manipulations. Let's go through them:
            <ul style="list-style-type: none">
              <li><code style="display: inline">==  </code> is equal to</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline">!=  </code> is not equal to</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"> >  </code> greater than</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline">>=  </code> greater than or
              equal to</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"> <  </code> less than</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"><=  </code> less than or equal
              to</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"> +  </code> addition</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"> -  </code> subtraction</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"> *  </code> multiplication</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline"> /  </code> division</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline">//  </code> integer or floor
                division</li>
              <li><code style="display: inline">**  </code> to the power of</li>
